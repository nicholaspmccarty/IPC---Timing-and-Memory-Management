# IPC---Timing-and-Memory-Management

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS)

## Description
This program is designed to benchmark and compare different Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms, specifically pipes, shared memory, and message passing.
